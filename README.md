# swordFlighting-IR-2023

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Sword Fighting Infrared (IR) Project - 2023 edition. This repository holds the innovative work on simulated sword fighting using IR technology, akin to light sabers, developed by students Pawarat Phatthanaphusakun and Lauren Seeto from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).

## Objective
The aim of this project is to create an interactive experience that mimics sword fighting in a safe and controlled environment using IR technology. It draws inspiration from the energy and excitement of light saber duels seen in popular science fiction.

## Features
- IR-based detection of sword movement and contact
- Real-time scoring system
- Immersive sound and light effects upon sword contact
- Safety mechanisms to ensure a safe play area
